### Glad to see you here! &nbsp;

I am a junior full-stack developer and partly Data Scientist. My favourite languages are Python, Ruby and Javascript. Just added Go.

As a developer with a determined love to create new things, with software applications there’s always something new to discover. I enjoy using my attention to detail to help solve problems sustainably.

I am open for collaboration, employment or others. Reach me at axel@meyabase.com

Do explore my repositories, some hosted at the [Meyabase](https://github.com/meyabase/). A number of them are also private.
